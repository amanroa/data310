# Final Project

## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence is becoming our new normal. Siri,
Alexa, Google Home, all of these machines use AI. Even 
every day machines and apps use some form of AI or machine 
learning to make our lives simpler. However, we learned in 
ethics that these machines that use AI aren't really "intelligent",
because everything about them was created by a human. Their
code, their algorithm, etc. Therefore, they cannot make their
own "intelligent" decisions. However, I would like to propose
a step towards creating "intelligent" machines. In class,
we learned about Text Generation. I want to know if,
using a dataset of code, I can get a text 
generation model that can learn how to write code and 
output its own runnable program. 
The program does not have to be complex, it can be something
very simple, but it will be very interesting to see if a 
computer can really write its own program.
